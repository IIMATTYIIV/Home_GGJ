# Operation H.O.M.E.

Operation H.O.M.E. was one of the resultant games for the 2019 [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) from the Austin, Texas location. The theme for this year was to depict what home means to you in a gameplay experience. Our team decided that because the Earth is our only one true home, we wanted to tell any invaders to Heck Off My Earth (H.O.M.E.) hence our emotioanlly charged title.
